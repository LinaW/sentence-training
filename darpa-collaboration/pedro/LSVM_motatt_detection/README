1. How to compile the code:
Just type 'make' in this source folder.

2. How to run the object detection:
You need to create a videos list file, e.g. videosList.txt, in which each line is the name of a processing video's name.
Then you need make sure that the corresponding video information are in the darpa-corpora.text file, namely the corresponding
relative folder path of the videos with respect to '~/video-datasets/'.

Then you need to have the object defomable parts model file, e.g. 'duffle-bag.mat'. Then in the matlab, simply run

===================================================================================================================
LSVM_Motatt_Detection('videosListFile', '<absolute path of the videosList.txt>', ...
			'objectModelFile', '<absolute path of the object model file, e.g. duffle-bag.mat>', ...
			'usingBatchMode', true, ...   % default is false, which is sequential mode,
							% in the batchMode, the detection will be run on the
							% background by matlab scripts
			'batchSize', 1, ... % default is 0 in the sequential mode,
						% batchSize is how many videos will be processed by the same process.
						% using '1' means each video will be processed by a single process.
			'imResizeRatio', 1.5, ... % image resize ratio, default value 1.5
			'attentionResizeRatio', 2); % attention region resize ratio, default value 1.5
===================================================================================================================

The parameter options: 'usingBatchMode', 'batchSize', 'imResizeRatio' and 'attentionResizeRatio' are optional. When
running without explicitly assigning the values for these optional parameters, their default values are used.

3. Data folder structures
The previous step of this object detection code is generating attention regions data. Under each video folder, there will
be a folder 'images' which has the expanded video frames. And aslo there will be a folder 'attentions' which contains
the attention region detection results for each frame after you run the attention region detection. The detection code 
will automatically go to these folders to find the useful data to use.

After you run the LSVM_Motatt_Detection, there will be a 'LSVM-results' folder in the video folder 
 which contains the object detection results.Then you can use the following command in matlab to create 
VOC4_overgenerated-<object name>.smoothed-tracked-boxes file, which can be further used to do tracking.

===================================================================================================================
CreateVOCDetectionFile('videosListFile', '<absolute path for videosList.txt>', ...
			'objectModelFile', '<absolute path for object model file, e.g. duffle-bag.mat>');
==================================================================================================================
